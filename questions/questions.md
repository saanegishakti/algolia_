Subject:  Bad design  

Hello,  
  
Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.  
   
Thanks,  
Marissa

*Question 2*:

Subject: URGENT ISSUE WITH PRODUCTION!!!!  
  
Since today 9:15am we have been seeing a lot of errors on our website. Multiple users have reported that they were unable to publish their feedbacks and that an alert box with "Record is too big, please contact enterprise@algolia.com".  
  
Our website is an imdb like website where users can post reviews of coffee shops online. Along with that we enrich every record with a lot of metadata that is not for search. I am already a paying customer of your service, what else do you need to make your search work?  
  
Please advise on how to fix this. Thanks.

Hi Carrie, 

Thank you for reaching out regards to the error. The error is due to a record beign larger than a threshold. There are two solutions for this problem. First solution would be upgrading your plan to Algolia Recommended, the pricing information can be found here: https://www.algolia.com/pricing/. 
Second solution would be reformat and break your records into smaller ones based on your use case. Reducing record size implementation document can be found in here: https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-and-managing-data/prepare-your-data/how-to/reducing-object-size/ .

Please let me know if you have any questions. 
Thank you
